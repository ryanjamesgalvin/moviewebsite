**This program assumes you have Python 2.7 installed on your computer**.

This program uses the Class Movie written in the media.py file, along
with the fresh_tomatoes.py script to generate an .html file that is a website
containing the movies in the entertainment_center.py file.

Run the entertainment_center.py file and the webpage will open. If you click a
movie poster, the .html file will open the movie's trailer from youtube
and automatically play it.
