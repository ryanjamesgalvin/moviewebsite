**This program assumes you have Python 2.7 installed on your computer**.

This program uses the Class Movie written in the media.py file, along
with the fresh_tomatoes.py script to generate an .html file that is a website
containing the movies in the entertainment_center.py file.

Clone the repository on your local computer using git by typing:

git clone https://www.github.com/ryanjamesgalvin/movieproject

in your git terminal, or download the files locally.

Run the entertainment_center.py file eitherby opening it from IDLE 
and running the module, or from the python terminal by changing your directory
to the repository by typing:
cd "your path here"

and then typing:

python entertainment_center.py


The webpage will then open. If you click a
movie poster, the .html file will open the movie's trailer from youtube
and automatically play it.
